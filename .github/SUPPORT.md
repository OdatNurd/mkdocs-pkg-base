# Have a bug to report or a feature request?

If you think you have found a bug in {{PackageName}} or you have an idea for a new
feature, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/OdatNurd/{{PackageName}}/issues)
on the issue tracker to let us know.

When reporting bugs, it helps to know what version of Sublime Text you're
using, what operating system you're on, and what version of {{PackageName}} you
are using.

You can determine the version of Sublime Text you're using via the `About`
command in the command palette. `Package Control: List Packages` will tell you
what version of {{PackageName}} you're running.
